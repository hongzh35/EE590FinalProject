# EE590FinalProject
## Description
This project is to build a embedded system that to simulate a car runing car that controled by a driver. It is based on the elma and existed cruise control and make the extentions. The system would contain two processes and several channels and one manager. The system would include a driver who can effect how the car runing and change the velocity of the car. During the running of the system, the real-time data of the velocity of the car and other information would be plot as one of the goals. The extra goal is trying to successfully send the real-time data as a UDP message to the other elma. The resources I will use include elma and UDP sockets.

## Milestones
1. Build cruse system that could simulate the basic function of the car -- 3/12
2. Enhance the pid control and add ki and kd. -- 3/13
3. Include wind, hills that could effect how the velocity changes. --3/15
4. Add a driver that could control the velocity of the car. -- 3/15
5. Include gear channel and brake channel that could be controled by the driver. --3/15
6. Expore data from simulations and show with plots  --3/16
7. Extra: Try to send the real-time data of the car as a UDP message to the other elma. --TBD
